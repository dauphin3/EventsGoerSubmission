# EventsGoerSubmission

Renamed Excite-o-plasm

For UI modifications...  added an option to leave the event via toggle button on "you're attending"
                         made sure to definte function for leave event in the DNA, as well as add traits
                         
Created a brand new Zome called Advertise.  I am only partially finished, so far I just added an invite option.
This could be used for inviting selected members or for sending it out to all available members.
The Zome can also have some advertising features written in as well, to broadcast hosted event, or other gossip protocols
to share news, discussions etc with members unable to attend the event.

I made notes in each location where the original code was altered or something was added.


Thank you for a great DevCamp!!
